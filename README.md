###[My Simple Stock Portfolio](https://my-simple-stock-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)

##### About the project
My Simple Stock Portfolio is my first full-stack application built with Ruby on Rails as my second project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course in Santa Monica, CA.

The application is simulation stock portfolio building tool where users can build their portfolios by buying and selling available stocks and adding them to their own portfolios. Users may buy and sell different stocks, and any given quantity of those stocks. Every user is provided personalized information about the complete portfolio as well as some basic performance metrics.

Those metrics are calculated with values from the database as well as values entered by the user. They are displayed at the bottom of each user's portfolio. The application is built with Ruby on Rails. All stock information is pulled in from Yahoo! Finance using Excel and VBA and raked to the database through a .csv file.

[The app can be found here.](https://my-simple-stock-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) You may also clone the repo, download it, run your server and go to localhost:3000 to view it locally.

Next steps include making my Stock Data from yahoo finance dynamically update by finding a more effective way of pulling and seeding the database. To build off of that, I will make the application automatically track buying and selling prices and add more metrics for the portfolio.
